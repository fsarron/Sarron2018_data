Data files giving data points for each subplots in Figures 11, 13, 15 and A1.

Data files are named according to the redshift and mass bins. '_all' are data points for the full galaxy population, '_early' are data points for the early galaxy population, '_late' are data points for the late galaxy population. '_RS' files corresponds to the red-sequence selection presented in Fig. A1. 

All files have the same columns 
# mag_abs_i gal_density err_gal_density

gal_density and err_gal_density are in units of  Galaxies . Mpc^{-2} . (0.5 mag)^{-1}
